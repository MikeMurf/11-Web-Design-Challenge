 The Web Design assignment required the use of the following components:
* HTML 
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* @Media
* Pandas 

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and @Media were used in the creation of the web pages. 
Pandas was used to create a HTML file from the data frame produced in the Python APIs assignment. 

The “11_web_design_challenge” directory contains the following files submitted for assessment:
* “web_design_challenge_dashboard” – the Word document describing the project,
* “main” – the Chrome HTML document which contains  the main Dashboard,
* “main” – the CSS Source file which describes how the HTML elements are displayed,
* “comparisons” – the Chrome HTML document which contains the comparative visualisations,
* “max_temperature” – the Chrome HTML document which contains the temperature  visualisations,
* “humidity” – the Chrome HTML document which contains the humidity visualisations,
* “cloudiness” – the Chrome HTML document which contains the cloudiness visualisations,
* “wind speed” – the Chrome HTML document which contains the wind speed visualisations,
* “weather_cities” – the Jupyter Notebook used to convert the Pandas data frame to a HTML file,
* “data_570” – the Chrome HTML document which contains the HTML table produced in Pandas.
